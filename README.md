A simple solution for a simple, yet complex problem of home security: locking doors. This project helps you to create
your own extension of classic mechanical door lock. You can change you usual lock into smart lock controlled with 
your smartphone, smart NFC card or with less smart solutions like numerical PIN, biometrics. You can even decide to 
control your lock via Internet, if you feel comfortable with it. Your lock your choice. 
Functionality of final device depends only on how much you want to spend time and money on it. Everything else is matter
of imagination.

Project is at stage of prototyping, but you are free to take a look, observe development, start your own project based on
our current progress. Just remember this project is still in development and some parts may not meet standard of security
or reliability you may want for your project.
