# Library consists of really simple partial stubs of micropython libraries
# making possible to run code designed for micropython on cpython environments.
# It is recommended to use together with mocking library and use this library
# only stubbing modules themselves, as these stubs are not guarantied to
# work exactly as micropython counterparts or work at all
